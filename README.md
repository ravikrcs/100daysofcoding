How to prepare for ACM – ICPC?

ACM ICPC(Association for Computing Machinery – International Collegiate Programming Contest) is a world-wide annual multi-tiered programming contest being organized for over thirteen years. The contest is sponsored by IBM.

This article focuses on what all topics that are important for the competitive programming and should especially be studied in order to train yourself for upcoming ACM-ICPC contest.
